# tool-kit

Our project is primarily a training project, which is a convenient and easy to use tool for working with JWT-tokens.

In our tool you can:

- Read and create your own JWT token
- Encode / decode Base64 strings
- Encode / decode HEX strings
- Calculate hash (MD5, SHA)
- Encrypt data using different encryption algorithms (RSA, AES).

We believe that our project will help our students to get the necessary knowledge.
